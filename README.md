# PiCademy Project 2017
This is a python project using the Raspberry pi Camera module, some LEDs and a button. It uses the Clarifai API https://www.clarifai.com/ to recognise if there is a face in the picture. If there is then the picture is tweeted out with a hello world message...

You will need to create a Clarifai API account and set up a Twitter App and update access keys etc appropriately.
